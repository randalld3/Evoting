# Evoting

This repository contains information and code for the team SMIRJ-Evoting. 
SMIRJ's project in this repository is titled "An App-based Electronic Voting System."

Project Description

SMIRJ will be developing an electronic voting system that  enables voters to vote securely 
from remote sites (rather than centralized polling sites). The system should be 
configurable  allowing  users  to  specify  candidates,  total  votes  available,  date  range  for 
voting,  and the winning  number  of votes  reaching  which  the  winning  candidate can  be 
determined  without  waiting  until  all  votes  are  casted  (think  about  the  presidential 
election process). 
 
SMIRJ is expecting  to  build  a desktop  application that is robust, user-friendly, and deployable. 
The system should include a user interface showing the voting results (e.g., the final votes each 
candidate received and the winning candidate,  and  possibly  the  vote  statistics  by  geographic 
locations  or  political  regions) for which visualizations can be employed to enhance the 
understanding of results.
